Visited the acclaimed [Clement Nursery](https://www.instagram.com/clementnursery/?hl=en) and bought my first [Peperomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peperomia).

One hell of a walk... but worth every step. It was started on a dairy farm dating back to 1904. Pretty insane selection and reasonable prices too. Potting was free and staff was hella cool. I plan on picking up a [Prayer Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marantaceae) on my next visit.

I've decided that I will only buy plants in person from now on.
