I generally define this trip as the moment I really started caring about photography.

On the plane ride to Tokyo, I read [Read This If You Want To Take Great Photographs](https://www.amazon.com/Read-This-Want-Great-Photographs/dp/1780673353) on a whim. I fell asleep twice reading the book, but it did teach me most of the fundamentals.

When I actually started shooting I could only remember one tip from the book that went something like "be intentional with what you are shooting."

Boy did that make a difference.
