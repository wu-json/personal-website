[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) is a React reconciler for the terminal. Used by Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Shopify CLI, Cloudflare Wrangler, Prisma, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Gatsby among others.

I didn't create Ink, but I use it heavily and have contributed a few things upstream:

- [**Incremental rendering**](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/pull/781) — Ink's renderer used to repaint the entire terminal on every state change. I added a diffing layer that tracks the previous frame and only rewrites the lines that actually changed.
- [**Terminal resize handling**](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/pull/828) — Fixed how Ink responds to terminal resize events so layouts reflow correctly.
