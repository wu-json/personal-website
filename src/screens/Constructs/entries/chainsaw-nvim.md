![Reze theme for Neovim](/images/constructs/chainsaw-nvim/cover-full.webp)

chainsaw.nvim is a collection of Neovim color themes based on characters from [Chainsaw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man), built with [Lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim). There are three themes — one for Reze, one for Aki, and one for Makima. Reze is objectively the best though.

These themes don't define background colors, so they inherit transparency and color from whatever terminal theme you're running. I'd recommend [carbonfox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) — it complements the palette nicely.

## Reze レゼ — The Bomb Devil
