I'm changing the direction of this site to be less of a disgusting resume shill and more something for myself - a working directory for my identity so to speak.

> Wow... That sounded way less cringe in my head.

That said, I don't expect this site to outlive me very long. Likely that I'll lose this domain when autopay finally gives out, or the hosting service decides to start charging me money.

Everything is mortal on subscriptions. Happy Valentine's Day <3.
